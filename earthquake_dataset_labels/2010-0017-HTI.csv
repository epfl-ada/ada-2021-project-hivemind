198671,2014-11-05-069646,"Samantha Appleton captured this scene as the First Lady and Dr. Jill Biden toured earthquake damage in Port Au-Prince, Haiti, along with Haitian President Ren√© Pr√©val, and Elisabeth Delatour Pr√©val. The damaged presidential palace is seen in the background. (Official White House Photo by Samantha Appleton) It was conceptualized and funded under Rene Preval, Martelly's predecessor. Such oversight is a recurring theme with this dynamic administration, who has consistently taken credit for hotels and other private sector initiatives as their government's own achievements. It leaves people with the wrong impression that Preval did precious little while he was in power. Preval's failure was that, unlike them, he was blas√© when it came to taking credit and was more concerned about building roads and schools than trumpeting his projects. By all accounts, Laurent Lamothe is a competent administrator who is doing his best with a bad hand. The prime minister has overcome a shaky start and has lasted as head of Haiti's government much longer than many pundits anticipated. This is not to say that this administration hasn't been working. It has. It inherited the aftermath of a devastating earthquake that destroyed the center of the capital, including the National Palace and many government ministries. During a visit in August, the Champs de Mars, Haiti's largest square, seemed to me like a huge construction zone, as destroyed ministries were being rebuilt. The makeshift tenements that lined the capital's streets, including the Champs de Mars, disappeared. This government has many projects that are underway to build resorts and make tourism the country's main economic engine. So it doesn't need to resort to false propaganda and outright sleigh of hands to convince people that it is working. Still, we won't know the impact of their labor until several years after they've left office. Because the Haitian constitution allows the president to serve only one term and step aside before he or she can run again, it's difficult to assess immediately the accomplishments of a government. Despite Lamothe's and this administration's self-laudatory, history will be the ultimate judge of their success. ‚áê More Than 1,100 Additional Haitian Cholera Victims Join UN Lawsuit New York Film Festival to Feature Story of Hope and Healing in Haiti ‚áí 2 comments for",Laurent Lamothe,Q57854,2014-11-05 03:40:41,1,['http://haitiantimes.com/lamothe-no-need-to-stretch-reality'],E,0.7257,['HA']

My gut told me it was the right thing to do this time. As a social enterprise with more than 24 years of experience, we recognize the positive impact and economic benefit tourism can bring to local communities. So we sent a team to Haiti to make the assessment on behalf of the IDB and discovered a unique culture with a huge voodoo scene, a modern art community, delicious Creole food and stunning natural highlights.

In addition, the looming end of Petrocaribe petroleum subsidies in the wake of Venezuela's economic and political crises increasingly puts Haiti's own budget and energy security at risk. Meanwhile, debt remains high, foreign aid slowed, and foreign domestic investment insignificant. The domestic currency, which has lost 40 percent of its value since May 2011, continues a downward spiral.

The five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the annual prize, discourages nominators from making any public announcements. The deadline for nominations is February 1, and the committee will announce the laureates next October. The Nobel Foundation did not immediately respond to an email about Andr√©s's nomination. According to its website, the Nobel committee `does not itself announce the names of nominees, neither to the media nor to the candidates themselves.' The committee also doesn't reveal any information about nominees until 50 years after the award is first announced. Last year, according to the committee, there were 331 candidates, the second-highest number ever. The record was 376 candidates in 2016. Only certain individuals are allowed to submit nominees. They include people who have previously won, past, and current members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and current members of a national assembly, such as the House of Representatives....
