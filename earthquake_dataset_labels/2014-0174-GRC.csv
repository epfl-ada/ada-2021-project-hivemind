226125,2013-10-14-041335,"Most shallow earthquakes in central and northern Greece (depths less than 50 km) result from interaction between the Eurasia plate and the small Aegean Sea plate, which is moving southwest with respect to the Eurasia plate with a velocity of about 30 mm/year. The boundary between the Aegean plate and the Eurasia plate in central and northern Greece is diffuse. Seismicity is concentrated in east-trending and northeast-trending zones of deformation. The east-trending zones are most prominent in mainland Greece, are characterized by predominantly normal faulting, and have produced earthquakes with magnitudes of about 7.",None,,2013-10-14 12:06:09,1,['http://www.inquisitr.com/991542/6-4-earthquake-in-greece-no-deaths-no-serious-damage/'],D,0.8985,['US']

84902,2017-07-23-084235,"When I was nominated Foreign Minister of Greece, in 1999, it was almost three years after the Imia/Kardak crisis that nearly brought Greece and Turkey to the brink of a violent confrontation. These events were the culmination of mistrust between our two countries: a mistrust that in recent history had its roots in the Cyprus problem but also the issue of the Continental Shelf in the Aegean. These conflicts had created years of frozen, tense and even dangerously volatile relations between the two countries. I was convinced that this impasse -- or even worse -- a war between Greece and Turkey could be catastrophic and certainly undermined the true potential of both our peoples; as well as the potential for Cyprus. We needed to find new ways to look at our relationship. Upon İsmail Cem's suggestion, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey at the time, we decided rather than fight about our differences, to begin a dialogue on areas of possible cooperation. When the earthquakes first struck in Turkey, in August 1999, the time seemed ripe to call on the Greek people to show solidarity with the Turkish victims. The response was incredible, civil society in Greece seemed to have thirsted for this opportunity -- that there was a different way. And the most moving moment was when a Greek fireman, after hours of digging, pulled out a young Turkish boy, alive from the concrete rubble. When less than a month later, in September 1999, Athens was hit by an earthquake of 5.9 costing the lives of 143 people and injuring thousands, Turkish officials reciprocated with rescue teams and massive public support. Certainly, the advances in live TV technology have played a significant role in bringing the tragedy of one into the television screens of the other. But, Nicholas Burns, the then Ambassador of the U.S. to Greece, called it a new phenomenon that you could call seismic diplomacy or earthquake diplomacy. Images that people saw on TV had tremendous political symbolism and there was an opportunity for both sides to build on that,",George Papandreou,Q151917,2017-07-23 21:03:52,2,"['http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/earthquake-diplomacy-another-casualty-last-week.aspx?pageID=449&nID=115872&NewsCatID=422#comment'
