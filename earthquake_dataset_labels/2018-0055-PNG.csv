59098,2008-11-15-005997,"for icelanders, the golden years were the early years, shortly after the land was settled in the ninth century. the viking tradition, the althing -- the legislative assembly dating to 930 -- and the literary canon of sagas and eddas are the nation's cultural bedrock. but after that, iceland almost disappears from the history books. while the agricultural revolution, the renaissance, the industrial revolution came and went, while the fine cities of europe were being built, while artists from michelangelo to mozart were pouring forth their creations, while the great inventions and discoveries were being invented and discovered, icelanders were hunkering down in their turf houses, meeting the hardest challenge of all -- survival. they survived plague, famine, earthquakes and volcanoes. there were times when some even considered abandoning the island. but they stayed on. they stayed and survived. icelanders will tell you that only the fittest survived, but that is only half the story, because survival requires another key attribute: stubbornness. and icelanders have it in spades. it is a national trait, and they view it not as a weakness but as a virtue. it comes from experiencing hardship and enduring it. it means finding satisfaction in a simple task done well and sticking to it; finding comfort and solace in family and kinship and being bound by those familial bonds and duties. and perhaps most important of all, it means believing in the independence of the individual as part of the fabric of nationhood, and fighting for that independence. put simply, the country has values. and this is what sets this catastrophe apart from the earthquakes and plagues of former years. this is a man-made disaster and worse still, one made by a small group of icelanders who set off to conquer the financial world, only to return defeated and humiliated. the country is on the verge of bankruptcy and, even more important for those of viking stock, its international reputation is in tatters. it hurts. (...) we live now in a foreign-currency lockdown, and although the government has assured everyone that there are sufficient reserves to buy essentials such as oil, grain and medical supplies for the winter, such assurances only serve to create a further sense of unease in a people who have learnt to take such commodities for granted.",anne sibert,Q29570538,2008-11-15 00:51:04,2,"['http://washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_11/015672.php'

Personally, I disagree with provincial day events and provincial flags. It only separates our unity as Papua New Guineans. I believe we should do away with promoting provinciality as it only stereotypes us into classes. Natural disasters like the Rabaul Volcanic eruptions in 1994, Aitepe Tsuanmi in 1998 and recent disasters at Manam, Kadovar and Mendi have brought back that unity of independence in 1975 despite our Provincial barriers. Learning of how Bougainville supplied aid to the victims of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Southern Highlands is a classic example of this story.
