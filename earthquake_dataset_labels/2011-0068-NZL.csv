We are committed to playing our part in a bright future for Christchurch and have been planning to hold gorillas for eight years! Our original plan was to create a Gorilla Habitat and it was due for completion in 2013. The earthquakes resulted in the project being placed on hold for two years as a result of significantly reduced visitation and income. The time delay led to a revision of the concept; through extensive expert consultation we set about creating a Great Ape Centre capable of holding not only gorillas but also orang-utans (in separate spaces)! We consider bringing gorillas to Christchurch to be something special for local people who have suffered so much through the earthquakes. Importantly, the development will be a significant drawcard for domestic and international visitors and therefore have a direct economic benefit to the region. Increasing visitor numbers is one of the vital components in the recovery of our city. The Centre is an important part of the Canterbury re-build and signals that Canterbury is open for business. As a charitable trust, Orana raises 100% of funds for each new development and generating the required funds for this project has been a commendable effort by our team. We gratefully acknowledge the grant organisations, estates, individuals and companies who generously provided funding for the project and thank the contractors who went above and beyond for this key development.

He proposed to me on Skype while I opened up the present with the ring inside. My sisters were there at the time and they made him propose again so they could film it. We had never actually physically met whatsoever when we first met in June after the February 2011 earthquake. When I came off the plane, I was very nervous. Mostly because I had a wedding dress hooked on to my back and a carry on case. I was walking down the stairs trying not to trip. He had his family with him so his sister took the wedding dress and his mum took the case. Then I was free to run up to him and have a big old nice long hug and a first kiss. It was a really great moment. We were married two months later. We definitely had to get used to. It wasn't easy going from not knowing what it would be like living with him to taking the plunge and saying we were together forever.
