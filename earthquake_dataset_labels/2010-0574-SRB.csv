48094,2009-08-22-032973,"the factitious [ fabricated ] symmetry with the serb victims in bratunac, which is supposed to annul or relativize the horror and magnitude of the srebrenica crime-when in only 5 days around 8,000 bosniaks were killed in a planned action-will continue to acquire new forms and dimensions, to end in a brutal moral inversion: in fact, it was the serbs who were ethnically cleansed from srebrenica under pressure, threats and blackmails by the bosniaks. such falsified picture will not be of any help for serbia in the process of democratization, nor in the process of joining the european union.",russ carnahan,Q1667920,2009-08-22 19:44:20,1,['http://srebrenicamassacre1995.wordpress.com/2009/07/30/serbia-and-remembrance-day-of-the-srebrenica-genocide/'],A,0.5476,['US']
2291,2010-07-31-013980,"i began to get news from croatia that told of slowly rising tide of murders, of unrepeatable atrocities, of massacres of defenseless serbs by berserk-mad croatians and by muslims in bosnian croatia. in the little back parlors the tales were whispered. i could not believe a quarter of them. unfortunately, i was soon to know that they were a weak understatement of the truth. men were to arrive in dubrovnik itself, hung with strings of serbian tongues and with bowls of serbian eyes for sale. the magnitude and the bestial nature of these atrocities makes it difficult to believe that such a thing could have happened in an allegedly civilized part of the world.",ruth mitchell,Q57251848,2010-07-31 15:30:14,1,['http://7zl1n38ksbn3.wordpress.com/2010/07/31/serbias-proof-of-the-links-between-nazism-roman-catholism-and-islam/'],C,0.5912,['US']

188561,2020-02-11-011778,"But he made, in my view, an unforgivable mistake against a player of the magnitude of Novak Djokovic -- he lowered his intensity in the fourth set for the benefit of the Serbian. After the first set in which Djokovic was superior, Dominic won the next two sets to go ahead in the scoreboard with a very clear strategy -- keep a very high pace in the rallies and try at all times to be the one to dictate the match. Sanchez Vicario: When I was little I didn't think about having a career like I had He did it to such an extent that in the third set we saw an anomalously crestfallen Djokovic in this tournament and led to some moments to despair. When it seemed that the strategy was clear and successful, and that it was paying off, he was not able to maintain it and we saw a fourth set in which Thiem began to cut his back and stop squeezing the Serbian. He lowered his level of aggressiveness and ceased to be the one who set the pace of the encounter. And, of course, giving Novak the opportunity meant allowing him to recover and thereby signing his own sentence. Although in the fifth set we saw a new attempt by the Austrian, my feeling at that moment was that it was already too late and the beast had risen. This mistake will haunt Dominic for a few weeks, preventing him from enjoying the great tournament he has played.",Toni Nadal,Q2118577,2020-02-11 15:10:51,1,['https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Tennis_Interviews/83910/toni-nadal-dominic-thiem-made-an-unforgivable-mistake-against-novak-djokovic-/'],E,0.6217,
