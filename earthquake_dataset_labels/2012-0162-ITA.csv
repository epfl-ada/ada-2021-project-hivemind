42252,2018-02-07-102867,Promoting the WBC Peace championship is something to be proud of -- said Salvatore Cherchi -- and I'm doing it with my sons Christian and Alessandro who joined me in our family's business. Emiliano and Victor are top fighters and will put up a great show. Part of the income from the show will go to the Box Val program created by Scholas Foundation and WBC and its `Fighting for the Peace' events to help the people who lost their houses after the earthquakes that hit Italy and Mexico. My Mexican brother Mauricio Sulaiman got this great idea of the WBC Peace championship and I'm happy to make it in my country and help people in the process.,None,,2018-02-07 16:41:52,2,"['https://fightnews.com/wbc-peace-ebu-championships-rome/13538'
