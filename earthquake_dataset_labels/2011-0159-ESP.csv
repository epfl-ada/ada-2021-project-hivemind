36232,2010-02-11-079940,"the key to our research is two-fold. first, the speleothem approach we employed is novel and extremely precise compared to other methods of sea-level reconstruction. second, mallorca appears to be particularly well suited to the task, because neither tectonics nor isostasy -- geological forces of crustal motion -- over-complicate the record. it's really close to the ideal scenario. it's also a heck of a nice place to do fieldwork.",None,,2010-02-11 21:24:14,9,"['http://sciencecodex.com/research_challenges_models_of_sea_level_change_during_iceage_cycles'
