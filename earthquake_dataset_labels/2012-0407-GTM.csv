According to its website, the Nobel committee `does not itself announce the names of nominees, neither to the media nor to the candidates themselves.' The committee also doesn't reveal any information about nominees until 50 years after the award is first announced. Last year, according to the committee, there were 331 candidates, the second-highest number ever. The record was 376 candidates in 2016. Only certain individuals are allowed to submit nominees. They include people who have previously won, past, and current members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and current members of a national assembly, such as the House of Representatives.... AndrÃ©s's nomination comes as little surprise.
