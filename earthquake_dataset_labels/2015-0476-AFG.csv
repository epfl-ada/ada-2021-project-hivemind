125094,2012-10-10-053000,"i've spent the night on the roof of the swedish nuclear power plant ringhals. more than 24 hours - and i'm only out because we chose to reveal our presence here. that shows me, how alarmingly easy it is to access the vital systems that supply the reactor cooling systems with power. the recent report on the eu stress tests revealed that in some swedish reactors, a loss of power to the reactor would lead to a nuclear accident in just one hour. i took part in this demonstration to draw attention to how little nuclear companies care about the health and safety of people, and how little they do to protect reactors from accidents. the gaps in safety recently revealed about swedish nuclear reactors are an absolute disgrace and a cause for alarm. nuclear operators have not prepared for obstruction of seawater cooling, for snowfall or earthquakes of a magnitude that can occur in sweden. the failure of back-up generators and several other safety systems in forsmark in 2006 were some of the most serious near misses since 2000, before the fukushima disaster. the authorities have tried to access the safety violations for years through soft measures: special surveillance, reports, investigations and revised protocols. still, blatant security problems continue. the latest evidence was a fire at ringhals just a few months ago due to a rushed start-up procedure. an intentional cover-up followed. the only way to end this continuous cutting of corners before a serious accident happens is for violations to have clear consequences: the offending operators need to have their reactors taken offline, at least until the worst issues have been addressed. the swedish environmental minister has called the operators in sweden, e.on and vattenfall, to her office today, based on this greenpeace action, and she has publicly threatened them with revoking the operational license permit if they cannot fix the problems we have highlighted. i hope she sticks to that threat and free sweden from dangerous, expensive and unnecessary nuclear power.",rex weyler,Q2147095,2012-10-10 18:46:00,1,['http://greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/blog/shh-swedish-nuclear-plant-security-missed-gre/blog/42536/'],C,0.5774,['US']

217404,2014-11-22-043653,"This diary reports on a recently published peer reviewed study by Steinhauser and colleagues in the journal Science of the Total Environment (behind pay wall) comparing the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear accidents. The diary is part of an ongoing effort to communicate the results of scientific studies into the impact of the Fukushima disaster on the environment. A majority of the radioactivity released from both Chernobyl and Fukushima can be attributed to volatile radionuclides (noble gases, iodine, cesium, tellurium). In contrast, the amounts of more refractory elements (including actinides like plutonium), released by Chernobyl was ~ four orders of magnitude (10,000 fold) higher than releases from Fukushima. The most cited source term for Chernobyl is 5300 PBq (excluding noble gases) while a review of published studies of Fukushima carried out by the authors above allow an estimate for the total atmospheric source term of 520 (a range of 340-800) PBq. Monitoring of air, soil and water for radionuclides after the respective accidents indicate that the environmental impact of Chernobyl is likely to be much greater than the Fukushima accident. The post is relatively information-dense as I have provided data tables for those who are interested in the estimates and the peer-reviewed studies from which they come.

The facility, which previously played host to the Argentine soccer team during the 2002 World Cup, was used as a base for rescue teams working in the wake of the 2011 earthquake.

' The main item of controversy in this week's approval was the NRC's agreement with the utility to consider waiving a mandate that nuclear plant operators have evacuation routes and other emergency response plans in place for a 10-mile zone around nuclear plants. Advertisement Regulators have now agreed that full-on emergency planning by plant operators could stop at a two-mile zone, or even at a nuclear power plant fence line, if it was deemed the radiation risks from a small modular reactor were reduced enough. FEMA has objected. The federal disaster agency said in letters and comment to the NRC that any consideration of narrowing or eliminating the emergency zone for the small modular reactors had to take into account the possibility of inside attacks, cyber threats, a national-security emergency, and other threats, not just calculations of radiation releases. Reduced emergency planning by plant operators would shift more of that burden to government, FEMA said. NRC commissioner Jeff Baran also raised concerns, and objected to exempting nuclear plants of all but a boundary-line emergency planning zone. Any consideration of cutting protections for people who live and work around a reactor had to take into consideration the possibility of a quick succession of disasters hitting, as with the 2011 quake and tsunami that triggered Japan's Fukushima nuclear meltdowns, Baran wrote in a dissent.
