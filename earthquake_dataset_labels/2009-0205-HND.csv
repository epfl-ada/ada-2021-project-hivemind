68501,2016-09-29-001565,"A black swan event has three key elements. First, it must be rare-like a million-to-one chance of something happening. It must have an extreme impact-much like September 11th changed many Americans, or a tsunami or earthquake that eliminates a major city. Lastly, real black swans are impossible to predict-yet using the wisdom of 20/20 hindsight, they will have shown signs of predictability though those signs were incomprehensible prior to the event. But there's another colored swan - the gray swan. It's a cousin to the black swan. It, too, is rare. It, too, can have an extreme impact. But its key differentiation is that, unlike a true black swan, the gray swan is predictable-though those who predict them are often cast aside and thought to be well outside of mainstream thinking. Identifying and analyzing the risk of gray swan events is something that is core to our investment philosophy. In the current market environment-stocks hitting new highs almost daily, debt at historic levels, interest rates at historic lows-gray swans deserve attention.

In the beginning of the film, we see the protagonist, the hero, as an alcoholic and someone who had given up on his career. That flawed character, to me, announced that it wasn't a usual film. It was courageous of Viswanath sir as a writer and filmmaker to do that. That kind of writing stuck with me when I grew interested in screenwriting. I have revisited the film on several occasions and with friends, have eagerly watched the song where Kamal Haasan stands on the well, inebriated.
