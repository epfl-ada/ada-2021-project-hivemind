129517,2010-08-26-068707,"ok, let's go through this one more time. half of all pregnancies end in miscarriages, usually in the first couple of weeks, before a woman even knows that she is pregnant. a miscarriage destroys an embryo. if you believe that every embryo is the moral equivalent of a fully-formed human being, miscarriages are like a perpetual natural disaster like a flood or an earthquake, and you should be urging a massive effort to reduce miscarriages as the best way to save millions of human lives a year. as far as i know, there is no such effort going on in the united states or elsewhere. but perhaps your concern is not the number of slaughtered embryos, but rather the morality of intentionally killing them or-worse, in your view-intentionally creating and then killing them. in that case, your attention should be directed to fertility clinics, which routinely create multiple embryos for each human baby they wish to produce. they pick and choose among the embryos that seem healthiest, and typically implant several in the hope that one-and not more than one-will survive. every year tens of thousands of human embryos are created and destroyed (or pointlessly frozen) in the everyday work of fertility clinics. there is no political effort to stop this work. president george w. bush even praised the work of fertility clinics in his speech announcing the policy that virtually halted stem cell research for eight years. advanced fertility techniques have brought happiness to thousands of couples who otherwise would probably be childless. they are a godsend that no politician would dare oppose. of the tens of thousands of embryos discarded by fertility clinics every year, a few are used for stem cell research. extracting the stem cells involves destroying the embryos, which would be destroyed anyway. true, the destruction of embryos used for research is purposeful, whereas the destruction of embryos in the everyday work of fertility clinics is incidental. but is that distinction really strong enough to support the difference between cavalier acceptance of tens of thousands of embryo deaths in fertility clinics and a legal ban on using a small fraction of these embryos to help develop ways to save lives?

44174,2013-05-22-001393,"A riveting examination of a nation in crisis, from one of the finest political journalists of our generation American democracy is beset by a sense of crisis. Seismic shifts during a single generation have created a country of winners and losers, allowing unprecedented freedom while rending the social contract, driving the political system to the verge of breakdown, and setting citizens adrift to find new paths forward. In The Unwinding, George Packer, author of The Assassins' Gate: America in Iraq, tells the story of the United States over the past three decades in an utterly original way, with his characteristically sharp eye for detail and gift for weaving together complex narratives. The Unwinding journeys through the lives of several Americans, including Dean Price, the son of tobacco farmers, who becomes an evangelist for a new economy in the rural South; Tammy Thomas, a factory worker in the Rust Belt trying to survive the collapse of her city; Jeff Connaughton, a Washington insider oscillating between political idealism and the lure of organized money; and Peter Thiel, a Silicon Valley billionaire who questions the Internet's significance and arrives at a radical vision of the future. Packer interweaves these intimate stories with biographical sketches of the era's leading public figures, from Newt Gingrich to Jay-Z, and collages made from newspaper headlines, advertising slogans, and song lyrics that capture the flow of events and their undercurrents. The Unwinding portrays a superpower in danger of coming apart at the seams, its elites no longer elite, its institutions no longer working, its ordinary people left to improvise their own schemes for success and salvation. Packer's novelistic and kaleidoscopic history of the new America is his most ambitious work to date.",George Packer,Q5543155,2013-05-22 18:13:55,1,['http://forums.somd.com/showthread.php?t=271682&goto=newpost'],D,0.656,['US']

The excuse of the day was deficits, but that is a laugh when the deficit that year was $5 billion dollars. The truth is the money was redirected due to the fear that captured the political elite of the era in control of the government due to the Vietnam war and the problems in our inner cities. This redirection was not just from NASA's budget, it affected basically all advanced technology development that the WWII generation put into play in the 50's and early 60's. Government advanced technology development has never really recovered. Politicians soon figured out that this redirected money bought votes, and thus piled on more, and have done so for the last 47 years. Today American federal policy is little more than figuring out new programs that will enable the buying of even more votes.

Heavily regulating the Internet will lead to slower Internet growth, higher prices for consumers, and the threat of excessive intervention by the government in the working of the Internet.

151172,2015-11-14-054421,"The primary metrics for success used by marketers and CMOs graph is interesting. One element that seems to be missing is the scale and/or magnitude of the opportunities. Hopefully marketers aren't measuring simply to the number of opportunities. It is important to measure to both revenue (closed/won deals), as well as pipeline opportunities' revenue, for a number of reasons based on client customer acquisition volumes. Measuring to pipeline opportunity revenue is mostly to obtain relevant data volumes to make more informed decisions about each marketing channel's success opportunities. The revenue gives the potential impact that using the number of opportunities alone cannot give. We have found, in our marketing efforts, that in some cases opportunity revenue for some marketing channels is high, but the conversion rates from opportunity to closed/won are lower. As marketers in the SaaS software space, we often explain it away to pipeline created early in the discovery and purchase process. That leads to one very important point in this process; strict alignment with sales and marketing consistency in reporting. The more detailed and specific your process can be in reporting opportunity stages, the more impact you can extract out of your data when using the data to make changes to your marketing channels.",Peter Dean,Multiple,2015-11-14 22:50:41,1,['http://www.business2community.com/b2b-marketing/10-b2b-marketing-experts-weigh-in-on-the-state-of-pipeline-marketing-01378476'],E,0.8439,['US']

His spot on the stage was boarded up and carpeted over. His barrel was also removed. Today, There is only one known location in Wilmington NC to still have this animatronic (non-operational).

68755,2015-10-16-095889,"The business environment deteriorated further in the third quarter. However, the cost reduction actions we took in previous quarters and the acceleration of our transformation program enabled us to protect our financial performance in what is shaping up to be the most severe downturn in the industry for decades. As a result of our actions, we have been able to deliver pretax operating margins well above those seen in any previous downturn and we have continued to generate significant liquidity with free cash flow of $1.7 billion in the third quarter, representing 170% of earnings. As we enter the last quarter of the year, the oil market is still weighed down by fears of reduced growth in Chinese demand and the expectations regarding the timing and magnitude of additional Iranian supply. However, the fundamental balance of supply and demand continues to tighten, driven by both solid global macroeconomic growth and by weakening supply as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments are starting to take effect. We expect this trend to continue as the oil market further recognizes the magnitude of the industry's annual production replacement challenge. However, for oilfield services, the market outlook for the coming quarters looks increasingly challenging with activity expected to be reduced further, as lack of available cash flow exhausts capital spending for a number of our customers, leading them to take a conservative view on 2016 E&P spending in spite of any gradual improvement in oil prices. In addition, the winter season will have the normal impact on activity in the fourth quarter, which this year is unlikely to be offset by the usual year-end sales of software, products and multiclient licenses. In light of conservative customer budgets for next year, we are therefore entering another period during which we will continually adjust resources in line with activity, as the recovery now appears to be delayed. We remain focused on managing our cost base, and are further accelerating our transformation program to help offset the impact of lower service pricing. As we navigate the current commercial landscape, we still look to strike a balance between market share and operating margins, while continuing to seek opportunities to extend our portfolio through targeted M&A, such as our transaction with Cameron, where integration planning is already well advanced. At Schlumberger, we remain confident in our capability to weather this downturn significantly better than our surroundings. Through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering, and our transformation program we are creating the leverage to increase market share, post superior earnings, and continue to deliver unmatched levels of free cash flow while bringing value for our customers through improving production, increasing recovery, and lowering cost per barrel.",Paal Kibsgaard,Q17099571,2015-10-16 19:05:45,1,['http://seekingalpha.com/article/3578786-schlumberger-the-pain-is-real#comments_header'],E,0.952,['US']

171816,2015-07-16-027548,"Having just returned from the US Women's Open, I am still trying to reflect on what was a fantastic experience and the highlight of my career to date. Although I was disappointed not to make the cut, I can look back on an incredible week on golf's biggest stage. Playing in my first US Women's Open and first golf tournament in America was incredible. The tournament is the best-run event I've ever attended and the course, the people and the facilities were all phenomenal. I am used to decent-size crowds in attendance but nothing on the scale of what I witnessed at the Lancaster Country Club, Pennsylvania. That was perhaps one of the greatest differences between the US Open and any tournament I've played previously. Having arrived on the Sunday, I played nine holes the next morning to dust off some travelling cobwebs and was amazed by the rows of people watching -- it was crazy! Most of all I was delighted with how I coped with all the nervous energy I had during the week. Holly Aitchison I don't think the crowds affected my game; I didn't really feel extra pressure as the atmosphere was so good around the golf course and I was able to soak it all up and really enjoy myself. I'll admit I certainly felt a few extra nerves during the event but I guess that's only normal in a tournament of such magnitude. My main goal going into the US Open was to learn as much as possible and enjoy the experience so that's what I tried to focus on whenever I got nervous. Playing in a world-class event against the world's best was a real learning curve and I've come away with a lot of positive feelings about the whole experience. The course was hugely challenging but it was beneficial for my development to play such a long golf course and test my distance. My ball striking was very good last week but most of all I was delighted with how I coped with all the nervous energy I had during the week. Going forward, I will be taking positives from my performance but I am really looking to kick on from it. I will be working on a few bits over the coming weeks in Europe, especially trying to tidy up a few edges to my short game and mental strength. My next tournament will be the Aberdeen Asset Management Ladies Scottish Open at Dundonald, Troon from July 24 to 26.",None,,2015-07-16 16:09:15,5,"['http://www.bognor.co.uk/sport/golf/xx-1-6852586'

When I was first approached through the British High Commissioner in Wellington in late 2014, and asked to consider taking up the role, I had to think long and hard about it. After carefully discussing the matter with the Home Secretary and her officials and seeking the counsel of those people in New Zealand whose opinions mattered to me, I decided that I should undertake the role, given my relevant experience and track record in the area. It was, however, an incredibly difficult step to take, as it meant relinquishing my career in New Zealand and leaving behind my beloved family. The conduct of any public inquiry is not an easy task, let alone one of the magnitude of this. Compounding the many difficulties was its legacy of failure which has been very hard to shake off and with hindsight it would have been better to have started completely afresh. While it has been a struggle in many respects, I am confident there have been achievements and some very real gains for victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse in getting their voices heard.

We're excited about the opportunity to start conference play at home unlike on the road a year ago at Vanderbilt. It will be a certain challenge for us. They're an excellent three-point shooting team. They're one of the top teams in the nation, shooting nearly 40 percent from the 3-point line. That's an area where we have to continue to improve. One thing we do know is that they have known shooters that we have to make sure we do a great job of doing a scouting report on. I think unfortunately as far as our setback against Wake Forest, that was an area where we not only not guard the line well, but they shot the ball extremely well, hitting 16 three-pointers. One individual went 8-for-11 and had been shooting 20-something percent from the three-point line. So any given night people can make plays. (Vanderbilt) has an individual shooting 60 percent from the three-point line and he is one of the players that they certainly depend on. They have good balance and we know in conference play things certainly change in terms of pace of play and the intensity level during conference.

37534,2017-11-09-070609,"I'm in Oklahoma on the last trip of my Year of Travel challenge. I've got a few more stops and then Friday morning I'm doing a live discussion in Kansas about what I've learned this year. In Oklahoma I visited a wind farm outside Duncan. Oklahoma is oil country, and they're still the third highest producer of natural gas of any state. But as technology improves and costs get lower, renewable energy is catching up. Oklahoma is on track to become the nation's second biggest pr oducer of wind energy behind Texas. One of the managers told me wind is now 17% of Oklahoma's energy. For the workers I met, they said working in wind energy is a more sustainable lifestyle than oil and gas. Oil prices are volatile, and any oil well eventually taps oil, so you have to move from place to place, often working shifts a few weeks away from home at a time. By contrast, wind is renewable and doesn't run out, so the jobs are more consistent and sustainable. For people in the community, they also said wind is more sustainable. In recent years, Oklahoma has started having earthquakes -- which they believe are from fracking -- when they never had earthquakes before. I was also curious to understand the affect of technology on the work. A lot of people focus on whether technology creates or destroys jobs. I've seen both this year -- improving tech has created more jobs in some industries and in others it has eliminated jobs. But perhaps the more common dynamic I've seen is that the number of jobs stays about the same, but in order to operate the increasingly advanced technology, people need more training and therefore get more pay. That seemed to be the case here. More efficient wind turbines means we need fewer turbines to produce the energy we need. But the turbines are more advanced and more complex to operate, so almost everyone I met had gone to special training programs to get these higher paying jobs. It's clear that wind and renewables are the future -- both economically and environmentally. That's why we power every new data center we've built at Facebook with 100% renewable energy, with a lot coming from wind. Places like Oklahoma are showing that what's good for the environment can also be good for the economy.",Mark Zuckerberg,Q36215,2017-11-09 16:18:09,1,['http://kfor.com/2017/11/09/mark-zuckerbergs-trip-to-oklahoma/'],E,0.5388,['US']

Once you make it into a House leadership position, your seat is considered pretty safe -- unless you have a primary challenger and the Tea Party is conducting an inquisition based on ideological purity within the Republican Party. Current Speaker Paul Ryan had a primary contender of his own last cycle -- more on that later -- but it already appears that he'll have a genuine challenger from the Democratic Party in 2018. An army veteran and union iron worker from southeast Wisconsin named Randy Bryce has announced he'll challenge Ryan as a Democrat. Based on the ad he released to go with the announcement, this is no vanity play. Ryan is sitting on a 25 percent approval rating -- with 59 percent disapproving of the job he's doing -- based largely on the barbaric healthcare reform bill he rammed through the lower chamber last month. That plan, which the CBO estimates would leave 23 million people uninsured and see Medicaid funding cut drastically to finance tax cuts for the rich, is making its way (in total secrecy) through the Senate right now. But it seems to be dragging Ryan deep underwater. He has demonstrated a nauseating lack of empathy as he's misrepresented the intent and likely effects of the bill with a toothy grin plastered across his face.

The U.S. Open is heading to Erin Hills in 2017 after the 2015 was played at Whistling Straits. Both are about an hour outside of Milwaukee, which does not feel like the golf epicenter of the midwest, but we might need to take a closer look. There is a tremendous series of pieces running right now in the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel detailing just how in the world the U.S. Open ended up at a place like Erin Hills. This venture just west of Milwaukee coincides with the grand opening of Sand Valley which makes its debut 100 miles north of Madison, Wisconsin. Tom Redburn of the New York Times recently visited Sand Valley. One theme he kept circling is how much Wisconsin, and specifically the land that contains Sand Valley, is starting to represent a sort of American Scotland. Here's Redburn: `The firm, sandy fairways, long open views, and exposure to strong winds would evoke the famous links of Scotland and Ireland and pay direct homage to the less well-known but well-loved `heathland' courses outside London. Mr. Keiser bought 1,700 acres from a tree plantation owner. He commissioned the golf design team of Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw, a former touring pro, to create a new course, to be known as Sand Valley. It opened last week. `There's already great golf in Wisconsin,' said Josh Lesnik, an executive at KemperSports, which will manage Sand Valley for the Keisers. `But soon golfers will look to Wisconsin as a place like Scotland or western Ireland, where they can go for a week and, within a short drive, play someplace special every day.

But in the end, manufacturers and producers of natural juices, various beverages, honey, edible oils, pepper, jam, sauces, wines, condiments, crafts, milk products will all benefit handsomely from what is in effect a targeted tax cut. Indeed, a recent survey showing that this key input is twenty-seven percent of total product cost underlines the magnitude of the step we are taking. To do better, Cabinet has as well endorsed a legislative redesign of both the Trade License System and the Building Act. The former, a consequence of extensive EDC collaboration, will bring greater transparency, predictability and proficiency to the trade licensing process.

In the interest of promoting awareness of this disease, a simplified description follows. It is a disorder that results in the degeneration of the central nervous system, and directly impacts motor functions for the body. As the disease advances, it becomes apparent in the form of slowness of body movements (bradykinesia), and the increasing stiffness (rigidity) of their limbs along with shaking (tremors). Eventually develop tendency to fall (postural instability) along with mild memory problems. Medications are the mainstay of treatment in Parkinsonism along with physiotherapy, occupational therapy and gait therapy.

These events were the culmination of mistrust between our two countries: a mistrust that in recent history had its roots in the Cyprus problem but also the issue of the Continental Shelf in the Aegean. These conflicts had created years of frozen, tense and even dangerously volatile relations between the two countries. I was convinced that this impasse -- or even worse -- a war between Greece and Turkey could be catastrophic and certainly undermined the true potential of both our peoples; as well as the potential for Cyprus. We needed to find new ways to look at our relationship. Upon İsmail Cem's suggestion, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey at the time, we decided rather than fight about our differences, to begin a dialogue on areas of possible cooperation. When the earthquakes first struck in Turkey, in August 1999, the time seemed ripe to call on the Greek people to show solidarity with the Turkish victims. The response was incredible, civil society in Greece seemed to have thirsted for this opportunity -- that there was a different way. And the most moving moment was when a Greek fireman, after hours of digging, pulled out a young Turkish boy, alive from the concrete rubble. When less than a month later, in September 1999, Athens was hit by an earthquake of 5.9 costing the lives of 143 people and injuring thousands, Turkish officials reciprocated with rescue teams and massive public support. Certainly, the advances in live TV technology have played a significant role in bringing the tragedy of one into the television screens of the other. But, Nicholas Burns, the then Ambassador of the U.S. to Greece, called it a new phenomenon that you could call seismic diplomacy or earthquake diplomacy.

42164,2018-01-22-056767,"It was known to local missionaries as `the Hill of Angels,' but to the occupying Marines, Con Thien was a little piece of hell. Just two miles south of the Demilitarized Zone, it was a barren, bulldozed plateau of red dirt 525 feet high and ringed with barbed wire, studded with artillery revetments and crisscrossed with trenches and sand bag-covered bunkers. To the east stretched the `McNamara Line,' the 2,000-foot-wide `barrier' ordered by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, which the Marines had cleared and sowed with seismic and acoustic sensors and minefields. The Marines at Con Thien were the human equivalent of a tripwire, there to block North Vietnamese ground incursions. In reality, the men became a sitting target for scores of North Vietnamese artillery pieces, which rained down shells on their positions 24 hours a day. Between February 1967, when they arrived, and their departure two years later, 1,419 men were killed and another 9,265 wounded; more than 7,500 North Vietnamese were killed and an unknown number wounded. At Con Thien in 1967, American commanders failed to recognize that loyalty should flow downward as well as upward. The commanders' loyalty should have been to their Marines facing the North Vietnamese Army as much as to their superiors in Washington. American Marines died in droves at Con Thien; they deserved better of their commanders. I covered some of the fiercest fighting, in the summer of 1967, as an ABC News correspondent. Ironically, perhaps, some of the bloodiest engagements came on and around July 4. My team -- our cameraman, Nguyen Van Quy; our sound man, Nguyen Xuan De; and myself -- didn't want to go, but it's the assignment we drew. My weeks spent at Con Thien revealed, to me at least, some fundamental truths about the Vietnam War: that our soldiers and Marines fought bravely; that the North Vietnamese were relentless; and that our military and political leaders had committed us to a war we couldn't win, and prosecuted it in the most inept way possible....",None,,2018-01-22 00:28:42,1,['http://1960sdaysofrage.wordpress.com/2018/01/22/a-little-piece-of-hell/'],E,0.8961,['US']

62710,2018-02-01-127849,"The rapid growth of the open science movement represents a fundamental shift in the way society approaches producing and disseminating discovery and new knowledge. The movement can be grouped into three broad themes: open code, open data, and open papers, each of which faces unique challenges. The primary challenge for the movement towards open code, methods, and data, is the additional burden researchers face documenting methods and sharing their datasets. This has been recently highlighted by the outcry in response to the NIH's attempt to declare all research a clinical trial. This move would force researchers to adopt much more transparent and open methodologies in all their studies, but it would also add an immense level of paperwork and bureaucracy to scientists who are accustomed to running small, nimble laboratories on budgets that are orders of magnitude smaller than what is typically spent on a clinical trial. Funders should work to provide and support lightweight, low cost means of practicing open science. Both the Open Science Framework and the BIDS standard address aspects of this problem. The open papers movement has grown from frustration with the small group of editors who control which new studies are worthy of attention as well as frustration with the publishers who are making a considerable profit from the enterprise.

In any case, with a shunt of that magnitude you want to make sure that you take the time to look at everything in fine detail and ensure that all the stressed parts are accounted for. The most important thing is that the driver is OK, and he will be back in fighting form for tomorrow's race. For Pierre, he was building this morning on some new directions we looked at last night to improve the car's balance, we had our ups and downs during Friday running, but generally the car balance was too inconsistent for both drivers. Pierre was happier with his car straight away in FP3 and was able to push with more confidence than yesterday. In qualifying, we could see it was going to be extremely tight with the teams around us. It looked like the Haas had a little bit of an advantage but otherwise it was difficult to predict. I think we came away feeling that we may have missed an opportunity for Q3. It was really close and unfortunately, Pierre had a bit of understeer in the middle of his final lap and lost a few tenths in the second sector, which left us slightly shy of the top 10.

The estimated global fractions of binary systems range from 10 to 50 per cent depending on the cluster.

And that I would be going through some things. â   The incriminating details: In their individual testimonies, Taylor, Kent, and Yovanovitch all appeared fully ready to discuss the magnitude of Trumpâ   s discussions with Zelensky. Trump claims that Biden acted corruptly in pressuring Ukraine to fire its former prosecutor general, for the purpose of protecting work his son, Hunter Biden, was doing with a Ukranian energy company. But both Kent and Yovanovitch made it clear that Biden was acting in accordance with official U.S. policy at the time in calling for that firing. Beyond disproving Trumpâ   s unfounded allegations against Biden, Taylor in particular shed bright light on why he found Trumpâ   s actions toward Ukraine so troubling. Taylor spoke of a State Department staffer who told him of overhearing a previously undisclosed conversation between Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Trump. Per Taylorâ   s recounting, the staffer said Trump explicitly asked Sondland about the status of the â   investigations, â   and Sondland replied that the Ukranains were ready to move forward. Yovanovitch, who was removed from her position after what she calls a smear campaign led by Trumpâ   s personal attorney Rudy Guiliani, presented testimony that helped explain the danger of a president and his allies allowing personal interests to supercede the countryâ   s national security. â   I remain disappointed that the [ State ] Departmentâ   s leadership and others have declined to acknowledge that the attacks against me and others are dangerously wrong, â   she said, indirectly incriminating Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. â   As Foreign Service professionals are being denigrated and undermined, the institution is also being degraded. This will soon cause real harm, if it hasnâ   t already. â   What we still want to know: Will the testimony of Taylor, Kent, and Yovanovitch be enough to persuade any Republicans? Will their long careers in public service sufficiently establish them as impartial, patriotic voices in an incredibly polarized political moment?

From what I can tell, she has ignored evangelicals throughout her writing career, except for a 2018 Times interview with Ralph Reed that puts evangelical support for Trump in a bad light. Weiss complains, `If the Christian Bible is the most important book in Western civilization and Jesus is that civilization's most important figure, the Jews' rejection of him and his message means that anti-Semitism is baked into the very foundations of the world we inhabit.' Yet an earthquake has dislodged this foundation during the last generation. A majority of the most impassioned Christians -- evangelicals, conservative Catholics, and others -- have allied with the Jewish people. Western hostility to the Jews is concentrated in secular Europe and the American left. Weiss has written not a book about anti-Semitism but an exhortation to the dwindling cohort of Jewish liberals who want to support Israel and defend Jews against slander and mayhem without abandoning the dogmas of a left that turned against Israel long ago.

139495,2020-01-16-027819,"I ask that any parent whose child might be a direct witness to a shooting be brought to our detectives as soon as possible so we can follow up on their information. There is much more to lose than gain in covering up a shooting if one did occur. If you believe this conspiracy, you're giving us and the school district way too much credit. To think that we could get a number of police officers, students, teachers, and other witnesses to keep an event of that magnitude a secret is beyond imagination. Today we have detectives going through what seems to be an endless amount of social media comments regarding yesterday's lockdown to make sure nothing is missed and to follow up on any relevant information. This is valuable time that's being taken away from other important investigations.",Eddie Wilson,Multiple,2020-01-16 15:53:08,1,['https://www.coveleaderpress.com/news/copperas-cove-police-chief-defends-department-response-incident-high-school'],E,0.5622,

185408,2020-02-18-081061,"The State Attorney's Office has been working with the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office since the shooting occurred. Last Thursday, after completing the initial investigation into the shooting, the Sheriff's Office presented its factual findings to our office. At that time, our office identified additional investigative steps that are necessary before making any charging decisions, and we promptly began taking those additional steps to ensure a complete and thorough review of all the facts and issues resulting from this tragedy. It is not unusual in any case of this magnitude for our office to conduct additional investigation beyond the initial investigation performed by our law enforcement partners. This may include identifying and interviewing new witnesses, re-interviewing existing witnesses, obtaining supplementary documentation, or seeking physical or forensic evidence. It has been nearly two months since the incident occurred, and although the Sheriff's Office presented its findings last week, we understand the community's desire for a quick charging decision. The legal analysis required before making a charging decision takes time even in situations where all the relevant evidence is readily available. In this instance, where additional evidence is needed, it is difficult to predict how long it will take to obtain that information, especially when considering the possibility of uncooperative witnesses and the potential need to compel evidence through subpoenas or other judicial processes. In light of these variables, announcing a precise timeline for any charging decision would be irresponsible. We will continue to work diligently to conduct an exhaustive investigation as quickly as possible. This investigation is now squarely within our office. To protect the integrity of our investigation and any prosecution that may result from it, we cannot provide specifics about the evidence or respond to rumors or speculation concerning the shooting. This office is committed to transparency, and as always, we will fulfill our commitment by providing whatever information we can about a pending matter without compromising the integrity of an investigation, while respecting the privacy of victims and safeguarding the constitutional rights of all involved. Furthermore, in this matter, we will continue to update the victim's family as our search for the truth continues. We cannot thank the family enough for the strength, patience, and grace they have demonstrated throughout this unspeakable tragedy.",None,,2020-02-18 22:56:50,1,['https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-hillsborough/tampa-bay-area-parents-demanding-truth-after-teen-son-killed-inside-tampa-police-officers-home'],E,0.8346,['US']

She was raised a Quaker and as a kid spent a lot of time in the community, helping those who needed it. She says: â   I started my practice of altruism early, and I never really stopped. â   Music also always played a big part in her early life: jazz and classic singer-songwriters on the turntable at home topped up by â   singing in every choir goingâ   through High School. When she arrived at the University of Pennsylvania, she joined an a-capella group called The Counterparts. A couple of years later, by which time Stiklorius was President of the group, a 16 year-old called John Stevens (later Legend) auditioned. â   He was this shy little kid, â   Stiklorius recalls, â   so I took him under my wingâ  . On leaving college Stiklorius initially worked for companies at the intersection of music and tech (she named her cat Napster in 2000), before getting her MBA at Wharton, where her final thesis was on the future of the music industry. She assumed that from there she would join a record label, but instead she was drawn back to the tech/media crossroads, first at Real Networks, and then LEK Consulting, where she worked with Kevin Maher (now a key power-player at Disney).
