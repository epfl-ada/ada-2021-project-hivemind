232440,2013-07-19-054883,"Strong Schlumberger second-quarter results were marked by significantly higher international activity, both offshore and in key land markets. In North America, we benefited from solid execution on land and further strength in deepwater activity to achieve solid overall progress despite competitive land pricing and the effects of the Western Canada spring break-up. Double-digit sequential revenue growth was recorded by the Reservoir Characterization Group and by the Middle East & Asia and the Europe/CIS/Africa Areas. All Areas displayed strong execution and integration performance that, together with new technology sales, helped operating margins reach or exceed 20% across all geographies. International results were led by the Middle East & Asia Area, as exploration and drilling activity rebounded in China and Australia, growth continued in the key markets of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and both land and marine seismic activity showed further progress. In Europe/CIS/Africa, activity levels rebounded in Russia and the North Sea, while increased exploration in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa further boosted growth. Latin America saw increasing Integrated Project Management activity, although the effect of this was offset by seasonal seismic vessel transits. New technology deployment was strong in the quarter with growing customer interest in new formation evaluation, drillbit and well intervention products and services. The OneSubsea? joint venture was completed with Cameron, and we look forward to the opportunities for the best-in-class new subsea technologies and solutions that we expect this new organization to provide. Elsewhere, our growing integration capability has led to organizational changes that combine our leading project and production management businesses to fuel growth through joint expertise and portfolio alignment. The soft global economic picture has changed little since the first quarter. The U.S. has shown virtually no impact from the financial sequester, the Eurozone remains in recession, and data from China continue to be mixed. Given the lack of change, supply and demand for both oil and natural gas remain stable, which is also reflected in oil and gas prices. E&P spending, however, has been revised upwards making this year the fourth consecutive year of double-digit spending increases and pointing to the long-term nature of oil and gas developments. As a result, we continue to see consistent growth as spending plans are confirmed by rig count outlooks and customer activity.
