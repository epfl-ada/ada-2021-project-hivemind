In today's world order, the role of IAF is not only limited to fighting a war but also rendering timely assistance during national crisis. On numerous occasions in the past, during natural disasters, IAF has been at the forefront providing timely succor and relief. The recent efforts of IAF to airlift our countrymen from Yemen, rescuing people during flash floods in Srinagar and the assistance rendered to the people of Nepal during the aftermath of a massive earthquake is praiseworthy. It bears testimony to IAF's glorious legacy of valour, courage and commitment. The nation remains indebted to the air-warriors for their selflessness and sacrifice. I am confident that the ongoing process of modernisation will transform the IAF into an even more potent and strategic force and it will continue to serve the nation with dedication and commitment. On this occasion, I extend my warm greetings and felicitations to all IAF personnel, civilians and their families. I am proud of the achievements made by IAF over the years and wish it continued success in all its future endeavours",None,,2015-10-07 17:20:24,1,['http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=128530'],E,0.6365,['IN']
